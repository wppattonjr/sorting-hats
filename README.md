# sorting-hats

Sorting Hats is a single page application used for sorting students of Hogwarts into their "Hogwarts House" at random. 

This is what the finished app:

-To start off with, it uses a bootstrap jumbotron to have the sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process (by clicking on a button).

-A bootstrap form then appears to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This then assigns the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin).

-On sorting a student, the form clears and a bootstrap card with the student's name and house prints below the form.

-You can also expel a student after they have been sorted, which removes their card from the student record.

-This app uses Boostrap 4 to style page components.

-It applies responsive design to tp the page (aka the app should be designed to work on small screens)

-The JS file is comprised of functions, no actions happen in the code outside of a function

-The HTML and JS all have proper indentation

-Helpful Form: An error message shows if a user tries to sort a student without filling out the form
