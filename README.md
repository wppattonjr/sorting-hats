## Introduction

Sorting Hats is a single page application used for sorting students of Hogwarts into their "Hogwarts House" at random.

Upon page load you click the "Let's start sorting!" button. Once you do that a form shows where you can enter your name and then click "sort". Once you click "sort" a card appears with the name of the "Hogwarts House" you have been assigned to. If you leave the name field blank and click sort you will see an alert error.
